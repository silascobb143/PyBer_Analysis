###### PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the new analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Along with using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

##Results:
* In the first chart you will notice that the largest portion of rides come from Urban locations.  This also means that more drives will gravitate to those areas in order to maximize their earning potetials. In Urban locations the amount of total fares is almost double that of the Rural and Suburban combined.
* In the line chart that we created it shows the trends for each fare by city.  This is a great way to give us the visual look that we need in order to have a clearer idea of areas that do better.
* Having the visual image of the line chart can also allow us to quickly see that the most fares earned($2500) came around March for the Urban locations.  While the lowest(near $0) was in January within the Rural locations.

##Summary: 
* If you were to make a suggestion on where to focus most of your business then Urban locations would be the best option due to the need of drivers plus  it is where you have the highest amount of fares earned.
* You could also focus on the Suburban areas as those locations could bring the riders into the urban locations as well as having some of the urban riders going to Suburban locations.
